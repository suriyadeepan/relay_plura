Optimal Multiple Relay Node Placement in Unstructured/Damaged/Disconnected Wireless Sensor Network 
==================================================================================================

## About ##

	This repository is a collection of projects in Wireless Sensor Network involving 1] tinyos based mobile nodes, static nodes and base station firmware 2] C based Simulation Framework of mobility models that generates Cooja compatible positions.dat plot 3] Example programs in C to test mobility, coverage and connectivity.


## Simulation ##

	- Open Cooja Simulator
	- New Simulation (or open Simulation -> simulation/basic_multihop_sim.csc)
	- Motes -> Add Motes -> Create Mote -> Sky Mote -> Browse -> main.exe
		# find main.exe from build/telosb/main.exe
	- Simulation Control -> start
	- Move nodes around and observe connectivity

## Results ##

	- screenshots of simulation and real time images are available in the screenshots/ folder
