## Optimal Multiple Relay Node Placement in Unstructured Damaged/Disconnected Wireless Sensor Network 

## About

This repository is a collection of projects in Wireless Sensor Network involving 

- tinyos based mobile nodes, static nodes and base station firmware 
- C based Simulation Framework of mobility models that generates Cooja compatible positions.dat plot 
- Example programs in C to test mobility, *coverage* and connectivity.


## Simulation

- Open Cooja Simulator
- New Simulation (or open Simulation -> simulation/basic_multihop_sim.csc)
- Motes -> Add Motes -> Create Mote -> Sky Mote -> Browse -> main.exe
	# find main.exe from build/telosb/main.exe
- Simulation Control -> start
- Move nodes around and observe connectivity

## Results

- screenshots of simulation and real time images are available in the `screenshots/` folder
